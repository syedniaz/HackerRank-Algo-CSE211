# HackerRank-Algo-CSE211
This repo contains all problems solved on HackerRank for my Algorithms course (CSE 211). Solved most problems in C++. Will add any future hackerRank problems solved here as well.

## Course Description
Techniques and principles of algorithm design including divide-and-conquer and greedy algorithms. Complexity (worst and average case) analysis and their associated asymptotic notations (Theta, Big O, Omega). Iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, insertion sort. Recursive sorting: merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. Sorting in linear time: counting/radix sort. Decision tree analysis: N*logN bound on comparison-based sorting.  Algorithms for graph problems: Shortest path (Dijkstra), minimum spanning trees (MST algorithms: Kruskal, Prim). Hashing. Discussion on NP-class problems (e.g. Travelling Salesman Problem).

## Just run the file in any IDE that supports C/C++ and a command line interface will start running.
